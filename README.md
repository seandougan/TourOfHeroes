# TourOfHeroes
This repo contains my implementation of the Angular Tutorial Application Tour of Heroes. 
Thanks @Angular Team at google for making this great resource for me to learn - Very happy with adding Angular to my software stack!

# Project Summary
This project contains a simple list of heroes and contains functions that can manipulate and render data from the data structure.
JxRS was used as a dummy-database and the application was refactored from its original form to support HTTP/RESTful architecture.
This code is a derivitive of angular.io tutorial tour of heroes and the application in its original entirety may be found there.
Thanks again @AngularTeam , learned a lot off of this!

# Installation Instructions
Will be adding in a few days ...
